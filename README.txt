this is a small collection of wallpapers that i've gathered through the years.
they're not mine. feel free to take them as you please, credit to the original artists.
if you want to contribute convert all the jpgs in pngs correctly, I tried to do for `f in ./*.jpg; do convert "${f}" ${f%.*}.png; done` but swaybg outputs a black screen for some of them..
